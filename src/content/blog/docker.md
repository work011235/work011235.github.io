# Docker

The strength of Docker is the ability to quickly deploy streamlined applications across development environments.  That way developer A can develop code, package it will all of its dependences, and developers B - Z can run it in their environents, replicating the original developer's experience.  

The challenge within my home lab has been coordinating operating systems and focusing the device's use case.  I was hoping to do everything with one device, which has proven problematic.  You can not run VirtualBox and Docker at the same time as the virtualization calls conflict.  At present, this prevents running Ubuntu virtual machines and docker on the same device.  

The following is a list of current, future, and abandoned Docker deployments:  

## Current
 - Coder (codercom/coder), 3000
 - VS Code (kasmweb/vs-code)

## Future

## Abandoned

Though not (as near as I can tell) deployed with Docker, Webmin is running and being listed here for the purpose of port documentation ().
