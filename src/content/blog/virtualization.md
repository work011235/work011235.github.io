## Virtualization

Devices may be physical or virtual.  Physical devices are easy to conceptualize - it's the phone in your hand, the laptop in your lap, the desktop computer in the corner.  A virtual machine uses a physical machine as the "host" and creates a digital recreation/representation of a machine with which you can interact.  Your physical device has an ethernet port into which you connect your cable which gets assigned an IP address by your router.  Your virtual machine has a network connection which get assigned an IP address as well.  Your physical machine likely has some sort of display or monitor.  Depending on what you are virtualizing, you may or may not have a GUI (Graphical User Interface, ie. "a desktop environemnt") to view/interact with.  

This concept is important in understanding the use case of a few popular sytems with a gross oversimplification of my current implementation provided:    

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Integrated Development Environment with extensive features and add-on's.  
- [Project IDX](https://idx.google.com/) - Cloud hosted IDE to build and run code.  
- [Coder](https://coder.com/) - Development workspace virtualization tool.  
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Popular versioning control system used to track code changes, store code, and facilitate collaboration.  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Virtualization software to package software for consistent implementation across platforms.  
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) - Container registry for finding and sharing resources. 
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Open source, multiplatform virtualization software.  
- [Hyper-V Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/manage/remotely-manage-hyper-v-hosts) - Windows Virtualization software.
