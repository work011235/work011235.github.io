# Nextcloud

Hosting data in the cloud is an incredible way to leverage cross platform accessibility.  But when your data is in the cloud, are you the sole owner of your data?  With the rising of machine learning models and bots to scrape and analyze data, your "free" account is paid for with your "content".  

 > "Nextcloud can be self-hosted and provides functionality similar with Dropbox, Office 365, or Google Drive when used with integrated offcie suites such as Collabra Online or OnlyOffice.  It can be hosted in the cloud or on-premise." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextcloud)
